# `custom-eval/` — 10 framework-representative evaluation tasks

## What this is

Hand-written tasks chosen to exercise the **breadth** of the dev-lead agent suite and the
typical surface area of a real-world software delivery engagement. Each task is one folder under
`tasks/task-NN-<slug>/` containing exactly three files:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `prompt.md` | The user-story prompt fed verbatim to `dev-lead` |
| `acceptance.md` | 3-5 explicit, verifiable pass criteria |
| `solution-profile.yaml` | Synthetic profile context (tech stack, quality gates) the agents read |

## The 10 tasks

| # | Slug | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `csharp-minimal-api-endpoint`       | C# / ASP.NET Minimal API + xUnit (csharp-implementation, csharp-testing) |
| 02 | `python-di-refactor`                | Python refactor + DI (python-implementation, code-review-checklist) |
| 03 | `bicep-storage-waf`                 | Bicep + Azure WAF baseline (bicep-implementation, iac-best-practices) |
| 04 | `adr-library-tradeoff`              | ADR authoring (architecture-decision-records, trade-off-reporting) |
| 05 | `pr-description`                    | Release-notes / PR-description authoring (engineering-standards) |
| 06 | `gha-oidc-deploy`                   | GitHub Actions + OIDC to Azure (cicd-pipeline-implementation) |
| 07 | `test-coverage-uplift`              | Unit + integration test backfill (csharp-testing, code-review-checklist) |
| 08 | `threat-model-api`                  | Threat-modelling (security-review reviewer agent) |
| 09 | `polly-resilience`                  | Resilience patterns on HTTP client (cloud-native-patterns, csharp-implementation) |
| 10 | `helm-to-kustomize`                 | K8s migration (helm-kustomize-implementation, iac-best-practices) |

The 10 tasks together touch every author agent (coding × 2 stacks — implementation *and* the
tests that cover it, infrastructure, architect) and every reviewer agent (code-review,
architecture-review, security-review, test-review, infra-review).

## How tasks are scored

See [`../scoring-rubric.md`](../scoring-rubric.md) §Custom for the long form. Short form:

- **resolved** — all acceptance criteria in `acceptance.md` pass
- **partial** — at least one criterion passes; the rest fail non-catastrophically
- **failed** — no acceptance criterion passes, or the build is broken

For tasks where execution is impractical (e.g., #08 threat model — narrative deliverable), a
**human reviewer scores manually** against the criteria. The harness logs the criteria to make
manual scoring fast (`runs/<run-id>/<task-id>.log` includes the criteria checklist).

## Portability

A downstream fork can:

1. Delete tasks not relevant to their stack (e.g., remove #03 / #10 if no Azure / K8s).
2. Add tasks representative of their domain — keep the three-file convention.
3. Adjust each task's `solution-profile.yaml` to match their real profile (region, compliance
   framework, allowed runtimes).

The harness will pick up any new task folder automatically — no manifest update needed.

## Adding a new task — checklist

- [ ] Folder name is `task-NN-<kebab-slug>` with `NN` zero-padded
- [ ] `prompt.md` is 10-30 lines, written as the user would phrase it
- [ ] `acceptance.md` has 3-5 criteria, each verifiable
- [ ] `solution-profile.yaml` is minimal — only fields relevant to this task
- [ ] First baseline run recorded in `../baselines.md`
